\section{Abstract}
I am lazy.  I do lots of problem sets.  I do lots of problem sets in LaTeX because I am to lazy to find real paper to write on.  I also use matlab because I am too lazy to find a calculator.  From one script I want to be able to do everything.  Screw MVC, I need what PHP is to HTML what I'm doing is to LaTeX.
As you can see here, $1 + 1=$
<?ml
1 + 1
?>
The integral of
\begin{displaymath}
<?ml
syms x;
latex(x^2 + log(x))
?>
\end{displaymath}
is
\begin{displaymath}
<?ml
latex((int(x^2 + log(x),x)))
?>
\end{displaymath}
